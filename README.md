Installation
------------

Because Tracklog is a standard Rails application, you can use your favourite
deployment tools to install Tracklog on your server. To run it locally you’ll
need to go through the following steps:

    % bundle
    % rake db:setup
    % rails server
    % open http://localhost:3000/

The default user is *admin* with the same password.

Todo
----

* Filtering of inaccurate trackpoints (maybe using the Kalman filter)
* GPS import using Garmin’s JavaScript API
* KML import
* Split GPX parsing and analyzing into a separate file/library
